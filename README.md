# stockbroker
Python tool to predict weather to buy or sell a particular stock 
## Inspiration
Inspiration is to provide people with stock predicting tool in future, to make my own Bloomberg Terminal.
## What it does
It basically calculates the percentage increase to the stock you are interested in the past 2 days , if the increase/decrease is greater than 10% it provide you the top 3 news article related to their stock or the company. It sends the user with top 3 articles as the separate messages. 
## How we built it
We built it using the python language. APIs used were AlphavantageAPI, NewsAPI and used Twilio for sms services.
## What's next for Stockbroker
Next for Stockbroker is to make this and launch this functionality into a mobile application and add maybe some machine learning to enhance the prediction. Maybe more like a Bloomberg terminal , actually better than that.
